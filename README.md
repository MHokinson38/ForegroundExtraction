Matthew Hokinson, matthew@hokinson.com

Various foreground object extraction methods 

## GraphCut

Implementation of foreground object extraction method described in [Interactive Graph Cuts for Optimal Boundary & Region Segmentation of Objects in N-D Images](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~yboykov/Papers/iccv01.pdf) 

### Description 

GraphCut is a minimum graph-cut based smart scissors implementation for foreground object extraction in an image. More description and demo to come.

### Results/Demo

## Usage 

## Dependencies 

## Tests 
You can run unit tests (located in `tests/`) by running the command `python3 -m pytest` in the root directory. 

## Coming in the future 
Currently only implementing GraphCut, but with hopes to add various other Foreground Image extraction methods for comparison in the future.
